## General

This game is written in HTML\CSS\JavaScript.

It includes a group of cards ordered randomly, the cards contain hidden icons that will be shown once the player clicks it.

Each card has only one matching card and the player should try to find it.

## How the Game Works
* One the player click on the card the timer starts.
* once the first card is open the player can go open a second card.

 * If the second card match the first one the two cards remain open.

 * If the two cards not matched the cards flipped back.
* Number of moves keep increasing each time the player open two cards.
* As the number of moves increases the stars rating decrease.
  * if it reaches to 12 moves one star turn into gray.
  * if it reaches 20 moves the second star turn into gray.
* If the user successfully matched all the cards a dialog open with the number of moves the player took, the taken time and the stars rate.
* the user can restart the game by clicking on the restart button.
